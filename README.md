# AdaBoost and XGBoost Classification model for diabetic prediction
 The dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to diagnostically predict whether a patient is diabetic or not, based on diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Create a classification model using AdaBoost Algorithm and XGBoost Algorithm. Use grid search to find the optimal value for the hyperparameters: learning_rate and n_estimators. 
 
### Dataset Parameters:
   * Pregnancies: Number of times pregnancies(0-14)
   * Glucose: Glucose Level (0-198)
   * BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (0-122) 
   * SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (0-52) 
   * Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (0-543)
   * BMI: Body Mass Index (0-57.3) 
   * DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes Pedigree Function(0.078-2.288)
   * Age: Age of Patient (21-81)
   * Outcome: Patient is diabetic or not (0 or 1)
